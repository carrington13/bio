                 Hi! My name is Casey Arrington and I am 26 years old. I was born and raised in Fairview, Tn; a small town (they call it a city, but it is little more than one road) approximately 30 minutes outside of Nashville. 
                I have two brothers and a sister. I'm the third born, so you could imagine how tortured I was as a child. I don't let it keep me down though. 
                I enjoy doing a wide range of activities, from anything outdoors (kayaking, hiking, climbing, scuba diving, admiring plants) to trying my hand at art and crafts (oil painting, drawing, wood carving). 
                Currently, I work at FOAMWORX, inc. but I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp to hopefully shift careers this year!  
            </p>
